# Thunderbots 2013-2014 Competition Code

This is all (or at least most) of the code used by the Thunderbots Robotics Team in the 2013-2014 FTC game "Block Party"

As this code was designed for a specific competition that has now expired, it is not likely to be maintained any further. Still, we welcome any contributions, and anyone may feel free to use the code for their own robot. Before looking too deep into the code here, you should check out our more recent by browsing all of our repositories. They can all be found at [github.com/Thunderbots-5604](https://github.com/Thunderbots-5604/)
